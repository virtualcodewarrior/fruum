## Reputation system (karma)

Fruum incorporates a reputation system using karma points.

Active users are rewarded with positive karma and users who get moderated for inappropriate content get negative karma.

Karma points are distributed in the following way:

 - New topic (thread, article or blog) gives you +2 karma points
 - Getting a reply on a thread you created gives you +2 karma points
 - Replying on a topic gives you +1 karma point
 - Getting a thumbs up reaction on a post gives you +10 karma points
 - Getting a thumbs down reaction on a post gives you -1 karma point
 - Getting flagged for inappropriate content by a moderator gives you -50 karma points

You can see your karma by clicking your user avatar on the top-right corner. Also, if you are online, you get karma notifications next to the avatar icon.

> Developers can change the point distribution on config.json under the **karma** section.
