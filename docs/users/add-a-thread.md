##Add a thread

Thread are the basic communication streams in fruum.

To add a thread click on the "thread" button.

> If you can not find this button this means that no new threads are allowed in the selected category.

After creating a new thread it will be visible in the threads list. Threads are automatically sorted chronologically based on the posts and content activity inside each thread.

The person that created the thread can manage it:

 - via the threads list, by clicking the gear icon on the right of the thread title, to edit it. In case the thread creator is an admin an additional options to **pin** and **delete** the thread are available.
 - for administrator created threads, inside the thread clicking the gear icon on the thread title. The administrator can **edit**, **turn private**, **disable posts** or **delete** the thread.
