## Manage categories as administrator

Fruum category is a helping element to categorize your main content.

Categories can be created within other categories (much like folders) and not inside an article, thread or channel. To add a new category click the "category" button at the bottom of fruum.

Displayed fields are the category title, a description and a category avatar used as visual aid.

Also the purpose of the category is defined that affects the content that can be hosted inside a category using the **use for** field with the following options:

 - Discussion, _the classic threaded forum_
 - Helpdesk, _used to host help articles or documentation_
 - Blog, _used for blogging articles_
 - Chat, _used as container to create chat channels_
 - Categories only, _acting as a placeholder for sub-categories_

The **visible to** field defines the permission of the category and its children and can be one of:

 - Everyone, _to allow even anonymous users to see the content_
 - Logged-in users, _accessible only to authenticated users_
 - Administrators, _for private stuff_

> A "Home" category is automatically created to host all your content. This category is also fully manageable by fruum administrators.

A created category is managed in two different levels:

 - Inside the list by clicking the gear icon on the right with actions for **edit**, **positioning** and **delete**.
 - When inside the category clicking the category **edit** icon on the top.
