##Storing search results

Administrators can bookmark search queries using **stored searches**.

An example use case is filtering out threads or articles than contain a special tag, e.g. **#bug**.

To create a stored search, hit the search icon, perform a search and on the bottom a "Store Search" button will appear. Click it, then enter the name of the stored search and select the parent category.

> Important: You cannot edit the search query of a stored search. You will need to delete it and create it again.
