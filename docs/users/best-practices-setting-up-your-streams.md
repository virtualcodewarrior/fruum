##Best practices setting up your streams
####Quick overview

Fruum comes with a handful of options to setup communication streams with a userbase. The available communication streams are:

 - Articles, like more persistent threads focusing on the first post (like a blogpost)
 - Threads, and
 - Channels, where users can chat in real-time

To organize those streams there is a category item where similar streams can be grouped together.

Managing those four elements and the possible options for customizing the we present some possible setup scenarios.

####Scenario 1: Setup a default forum under a category

01. **Create the category**. Giving a proper name and description are important, also pay attention to category's avatar and letters used for the avatar.
02. **Manage category actions**. After creating the category setup the possible actions within the category by clicking the gear icon on the avatar of the category. **Allow only new threads**, thus disabling creation of new channels in the category.
03. **Administer your thread category**, by monitoring created threads and pinning important threads. Users have the ability to report a post so as an administrator keep an eye for notification emails to manage incoming reports. An administrator could also make a category private so that only logged in users have access to it.

####Scenario 2: Setup a single channel for real-time chat in a category

01. As an administrator visit the category and check for the add channel button. If there is **no add channel** button it means that this category does not allow channel creation. In that case manage category actions and enable channel creation.
02. Click the **add channel button** while in the category, again give a descriptive channel name.
03. After creating the channel, **disable channel creation** from the manage category actions.

####Scenario 3: Setup an articles-only category ( Documentation and admin curated content only )

01. **Create the category**, try to be descriptive on the name and description and pay attention to avatar colors and letters.
02. **Manage category actions** and disable both new threads and new channels creation. Now only administrators can add articles to this category
03. **Allow/disallow posts** for each article according to category's specific needs.
04. **Curate articles** by sorting them according to importance

####To sum up

Fruum allows for many customizations. Above are some representative setups that by no means are the only ones available. Adjust fruum to specific use cases based on each category's actions setup and your selected streams allowed actions (private, pin, allow/disallow posts).

>    When all options are available within a category the elements are organized in a specific order:
>
> 01. Categories list (sortable)
> 02. Articles list (sortable)
> 03. Threads list (recently updated first)
> 04. Channels list (recently updated first)
