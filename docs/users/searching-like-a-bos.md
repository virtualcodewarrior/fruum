## Searching (like a boss)

Fruum is empowered by elasticsearch, so search should be awesome.

To search hit the search icon on the top and enter a string. You can search inside:

    Threads and replies
    Articles and comments
    Blogs and comments

e.g. _"api"_

You can search for tags using the **#tag** format, e.g. _"#bug #fixed"_

and for users using the **@username**, e.g. _@johnsnow_

More advanced search options:

 - Search in parent category: _parent:slug_
 - Disable word highlighting: _highlight:0_
 - Set max results: _maxresults:number_
 - Search by content type: _type:thread|article|blog|post_
 - Sort by creation date: _sort:created|created_asc_
 - Sort by update date: _sort:updated|updated_asc_
 - Sort by username: _sort:user|user_asc_
