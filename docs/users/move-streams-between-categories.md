## Move streams between categories

When you maintain a fruum with multiple categories, it is often useful to move threads, articles or channels around. For example, a user may create a thread that its content applies better to another category. The moderator should be able to do that.

Moving things around requires administrator permissions. On the list of articles, threads or channels you can find a "move" symbol (like <) inside the gear icon. Clicking it will reveal a popup of categories that you can move the selected stream into.
