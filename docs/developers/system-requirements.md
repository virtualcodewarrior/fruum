##System requirements

The minimum system requirement for running fruum is a node.js environment.

Your node.js version must be greater than 8.x.x and npm greater than 5.x.x.

Fruum is using 3 sub modules in order operate:

 - Database module
 - Cache module
 - Email module

Those modules can be replaced by drivers in order to glue with any backend system, such as sql or no-sql databases, email services, memcached or redis storage etc.

> Fruum comes with memory cache and elasticsearch database backends out of the box, so to get up and running you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
